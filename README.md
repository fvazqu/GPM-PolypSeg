# GPM-PolypSeg

## Overview

GPM (Geometry-Prompt Module) is a lightweight plug-in module designed to inject geometric priors into U-Net models and its variants for robust polyp segmentation.

📂 **Dataset:**  
The polyp segmentation dataset used in this work is available on  
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEJ_MgzSsYWzMvSe-aweAth_VtaTPPgX/view?usp=drive_link).  

The dataset is **pre-split into training and testing sets** and consists of samples from the following publicly available polyp segmentation datasets:
- **Kvasir-SEG**
- **CVC-ClinicDB**
- **CVC-ColonDB**
- **CVC-300**
- **ETIS-LaribPolypDB**

Each subset includes the corresponding **RGB images, ground-truth masks, and depth maps**.
